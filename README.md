# openGL_Shaders
This is the same as my other openGL vertices file but it has more in depth shaders and better orginised code 

note that this will NOT work if you copy and paste it into a new visual studio project, you need to install openGL glad and glfw

i also removed the glad file as it is a C file that was downloded (not coded by me)

This is the youtube channel i followed the tutorial off
